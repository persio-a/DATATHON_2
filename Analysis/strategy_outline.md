# Strategy : churn reducing strategies

## Key objectives

### Increase sales

Limitations
- Limited students
- Limited educational clients (professors or institutions)

Tactics
- Find more clients by increasing seller prospection activities in more territories (show map, based on low customer density areas)
- Increase product offering diversity, our competitors offer many products we do not

### Mitigate customer churn from underperforming sellers

Limitations
- Underperforming sellers (show graph)

Tactics
- Switch some clients amongst least churner sellers and most, to identify if variation is because of seller performance or client similarities
- Once identified either change clients or develop specific strategies to asses these clients

### Marketing actions

Limitations
- We don't know what these actions correspond to, costs associated to it or any other factors that may limit how many actions we can perform by client. Assuming no limitations:

Tactics
- Increase number of actions performed per client
- Reduce as much as possible marketing action 1, customer seem to churn most frequently

### Increase reps

Limitations
- We don't exactly know what representatives, but when we have more churn decreases

Tactics
- Get more reps per customer
